M.A.R.C: A SMART AI BASED DESKTOP ASSISTANT FOR PERSONALIZED ASSISTANCE AND AUTOMATION

Introduction:

The rapid development of technology has led to the increasing use of machines to replace human labor in various tasks. One of the key factors driving this trend is the significant improvements in performance that machines offer. In the modern world, we have made great strides in teaching machines to think and perform tasks on their own, which has given rise to the concept of a virtual assistant. 

The Personalized AI-based Virtual Assistant is a software application designed to interact with users through natural language processing and voice recognition. It is a digital assistant that is designed to learn the user's preferences, habits, and behavior to provide personalized responses. This virtual assistant can help users with various tasks, such as scheduling appointments, setting reminders, making phone calls, sending messages, playing music and more. The software application is designed to be integrated with other apps and services to provide a seamless user experience.

Brief:

This Project is based on an A.I based desktop assistant which is composed 
of a chatbot and a voice recognition system. The chatbot will give response 
to user queries like a personal assistant through use of deep learning 
algorithms.
